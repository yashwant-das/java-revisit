# **Abstract Inner Class:**

An **abstract inner class** is an inner class that is declared with the `abstract` keyword. It is similar to a regular abstract class but is defined within another class. Abstract inner classes can have abstract methods (methods without implementation) and concrete methods. They are typically used when the functionality needs to be shared among subclasses.

Here's an example:

```java
class Outer {
    abstract class AbstractInner {
        abstract void abstractMethod();
        
        void concreteMethod() {
            System.out.println("Concrete method in AbstractInner class");
        }
    }
}

class ConcreteSubclass extends Outer.AbstractInner {
    @Override
    void abstractMethod() {
        System.out.println("Abstract method implementation in ConcreteSubclass");
    }
}

public class AbstractInnerClassExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ConcreteSubclass subclass = new ConcreteSubclass();
        subclass.abstractMethod();
        subclass.concreteMethod();
    }
}
```

In this example, `AbstractInner` is an abstract inner class within the `Outer` class. The `ConcreteSubclass` extends `Outer.AbstractInner` and provides an implementation for the abstract method.

**Anonymous Inner Class:**

An **anonymous inner class** is a class without a name that is defined and instantiated at the same time. It is often used when a simple, one-time implementation of a class or interface is needed. Anonymous inner classes are commonly used in scenarios like event handling and interface implementation.

Here's an example:

```java
interface Greet {
    void sayHello();
}

public class AnonymousInnerClassExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating an anonymous inner class implementing the Greet interface
        Greet greet = new Greet() {
            @Override
            public void sayHello() {
                System.out.println("Hello from anonymous inner class");
            }
        };

        greet.sayHello();
    }
}
```

In this example, an anonymous inner class is created to implement the `Greet` interface. The `sayHello` method is overridden within the anonymous class.

In summary, abstract inner classes are used when a common base class is needed for multiple subclasses, and anonymous inner classes are used for short-lived, one-time implementations, especially in scenarios like interface implementations and event handling.
